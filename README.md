## 🤖 Prerequisites/Dependencies
- **OS**: Linux (tested). macOS should work; Windows is untested.
- **Python (stim-env)**: Python 3.10.x (tested with 3.10.16). Saved artifacts use pickle protocol 5, so use Python ≥3.8 (3.10 recommended) to ensure compatibility.
- **Environment setup**:
  - Create a virtual environment (recommended name: `stim-env`).
  - Install Python deps via the pinned `requirements.txt` at the repo root.
  - Additional packages not pinned in `requirements.txt` but required by the code:
    - `ieeg` (Python client for iEEG.org). Install from source at `https://github.com/ieeg-portal/ieegpy`
- **GPU (optional)**:
  - The pinned wheels target CUDA 12.x (e.g., torch 2.2.0 + cu12 and TensorFlow 2.16.1). Ensure a compatible NVIDIA driver and CUDA runtime if using GPU. CPU-only runs are supported but slower.
- **Jupyter**: JupyterLab 4.x is included in `requirements.txt` for running notebooks.
- **MNE-BIDS**: `mne`, `mne-bids` are pinned and required for BIDS I/O and analyses.
- **Stats/ML libraries**: `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and others are pinned in `requirements.txt`.
- **R (for mixed-effects models and stats in `code/*.R`)**: R ≥4.1 with the following packages installed:
  - `lme4`, `lmerTest`, `pbkrtest`, `dplyr`, `emmeans`, `multcomp`, `car`, `nlme`
- **Access to iEEG.org**:
  - An iEEG.org account is required to download raw EEG.
  - The config expects `IEEG_USR` (username) and an `IEEG_PWD` path to a binary file containing the password.

## Quick start
- Create and activate the environment, then install Python deps:
  ```bash
  python3.10 -m venv stim-env
  source stim-env/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install git@github.com:ieeg-portal/ieegpy.git  # if not already present in your env
  ```
- Install R dependencies (one-time):
  ```r
  install.packages(c("lme4","lmerTest","pbkrtest","dplyr","emmeans","multcomp","car","nlme"))
  ```
- Download data checkpoints from (link here soon!) 
- Update config.py
    - usr - *ieeg.org username*
    - passpath - *Path to ieeg.org login binary password file*
    - RAW_DATA - *Path to raw data and localizations, this folder is not required for the quick run*
    - PROCESSED_DATA - *Path to processed data checkpoints, required*
    - METADATA - *Path to patient and seizure metadata, required*
    - figures - *Path to saved figures, required*
- Run quickstart.sh
  ```bash
  
  ```

          
## Data
all raw EEG data is publically available on iEEG.org and will be uploaded in BIDS format as a publcially available dataset on pennsive.io upon publication. The script BIDS_seizure_saving.py contains code used to save the raw EEG data into BIDS format from ieeg.org.

## Analysis pipeline
* annotation_analysis_and_consensys.ipynb
notebook to generate consensus thresholds and perform seizure similarity analysis (Figure SX). Run this first to generate threshold_tuning_consensus_v2.pkl, which contains the consensus annotations for each annotated seizure.
* BIDS_seizure_saving.py
script to pull seizure data from iEEG.org and save it in iEEG-BIDS format using mne python. Saves all seizures in seizure_information-LF that are spontaneous (stim == 0) or low-frequency stim-induced (stim == 1)
* BIDS_interictal_saving.py
script to pull the designated interictal data from iEEG.org and save it in iEEG-BIDS format using mne python. Saves all interictal clips as designated in the config, one for each patient.
* seizure_detection_pretrain.py
script to generate seizure detection values for each spontaneous and stimulation induced seizure using the NDD model and two benchmarks: Absolute slope, and a wavenet-based univariate seizure detector.
* val_generate_model_annotations.py
script to generate ueo channel and 10 second spread channel annotations for each seizure that had human annotations at each threshold in a parameter sweep.
* val_threshold_sweep_merging.py
script for merging human annotations and model annotations at each of the swept thresholds
* tuning_model_thresholds.ipynb
notebook containing code to visualize model performances and compare them to model performances
* lme_model_analysis.R
* val_generate_optimized_model_annotations.py
* model_prediction_analysis_cursor.ipynb
* lme_recruitment_analysis.R
* lme_semiology_mtle_analysis.R
* lme_spont_spread_analysis.R
* utils
    * utils.py
    * stim_seizure_preprocessing_utils.py
* visualizations
    * end2end_sandbox.ipynb
